# B-Tree
B Tree Created Using Java. The application demonstrates the basic operations of a b tree(search, insert, delete, max, min, etc).
The B-Tree grows and shrinks unlike Binary Search Trees and all keys of a node are sorted in increasing order. This project was assigned to my Principals of Programming Languages course. 

# What I Learned
* How to populate an array and iterate through it
* How to an abstract class as a template for other specific classes
* How to use Recursion to adds clarity and reduces the time needed to write and debug code
